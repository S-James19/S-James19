I am currently a 2nd year BSc Computer Science student studying at Falmouth University. This has allowed me to build skills and gain experience working in team projects. I love to code, and love the challenge of trying to build things and figure out why exactly they work. 

Languages:
C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
